# Goal: map .wav files to common English syllables   
step 0: Have a list of wav files ( about 100ish )  
step 1: Find common syllables in English ( will be about 1000ish)  
step 2: Distribute the wav file 'evenly' across the set of syllable. But! The more popular a given syllable is in actual usage remove the potential of a wav file to be assigned to another syllable ( TODO: Clarity )
